what is the relationship between a BLS public key and a KNOT?

let me know if this doesn’t answer your question https://docs.joinstakehouse.com/protocol/learn/knots

KNOTs | Blockswap docs
Creating a KNOT mints derivative ETH (dETH) and liquid validator (SLOT) tokens.

thanks


[11/13/2022 01:32] chaduke3730
I think ONE BLS pub key is for one KNOT

[11/13/2022 04:22] vdecentralised
That’s right @chaduke A knot is a validator that has minted derivatives and every validator has its unique BLS pub key.


[11/13/2022 04:23] vdecentralised
Tests give clues about the lifecycle of a validator registering within an LSD network

Oh, this is the first contest I've been in where some portion of the code has already been covered by Runtime Verification.
If I'm reading their report correctly, they covered a few core contracts, but this contest includes several more?


[11/14/2022 17:28] vdecentralised
Runtime verification has done the underlying Stakehouse protocol. This contest is for the LSD on top of Stakehouse protocol. Hope this helps


[11/14/2022 18:11] lukejohn_
can we have the source code of StakehouseAPI.sol?

[11/14/2022 19:02] trustminimised
@vdecentralised Does the ability for LPers to burn their tokens for the underlying ETH rely on Shanghai being live? I assume it does but the choice between ETH and dETH is muddying the description for me.


[11/14/2022 19:32] vdecentralised
Good question. Un staking validators at the stakehouse level will require Shanghai in order to retrieve staked ETH. However, in the context of LSD, any unstaked ETH that never gets sent to the deposit contract can always be retrieved by a user that burns their LP. So basically if your ETH capital is never deployed, you can easily get it back


[11/14/2022 19:36] trustminimised
Thanks!


[11/14/2022 20:14] trustminimised
@vdecentralised Can you shed any light on this check in `GiantMevAndFeesPool` / `GiantSavETHVaultPool` `batchRotateLPTokens()`?
`require(lpTokenETH.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= 0.5 ether, "No common interest");`


[11/14/2022 21:28] vdecentralised
That operation is an inventory management operation. We didn’t want it triggered by small depositors or depositors with a small amount of common interest.

savETH registry and SLOT registry have been verified


[11/15/2022 13:41] vdecentralised
but like we say, Stakehouse protocol is out of scope for this competition but we do appreciate as LSD is a layer on top of the Stakehouse platform, you'll need to wrap your head around some concepts


[11/15/2022 13:42] vdecentralised
don't forget, the pinned messages that link to our docs


[11/15/2022 16:42] lukejohn_
How can people withdraw eth from a smart wallet, via which function?


[11/15/2022 18:00] vdecentralised
`LiquidStakingManager::withdrawETHForKnot()`


[11/15/2022 18:27] lukejohn_
thanks.


[11/15/2022 18:27] lukejohn_
I wonder why ``_autoStakeWithSyndicate`` always stake 12 eth each time


[11/15/2022 18:28] vdecentralised
it's a scaled SLOT balance


[11/15/2022 18:28] lukejohn_
ok.


[11/15/2022 18:29] vdecentralised
so every Stakehouse KNOT mints 8 SLOT - 4 SLOT for node runner and 4 for fees and MEV - sETH is a scaled balance of the SLOT 🙂


[11/15/2022 18:30] vdecentralised
that's how revenue at Syndicate level works - 50% to fees and mev and 50% to node runners


[11/15/2022 18:49] lukejohn_
thanks for the clarification


[11/15/2022 18:53] lukejohn_
who can withdraw sETH and how?


[11/15/2022 19:24] vdecentralised
in LSD - sETH is just an accounting token to distribute fees and mev


[11/15/2022 19:25] vdecentralised
only time it can be removed is when LSD winds down all validators and rage quits each validator


[11/15/2022 19:30] lukejohn_
Got it, thanks again


[11/15/2022 19:34] lukejohn_
when and where sETH gets minted then?


[11/15/2022 19:36] vdecentralised
sETH comes from Stakehouse protocol and is minted to the smart wallet but then auto staked as you have seen


[11/15/2022 19:38] lukejohn_
thanks Yes, I saw sETH was received only after _createLSDN


[11/15/2022 19:41] lukejohn_
I guess the smartwallet will receive sETH by calling createTakehouse() via the router.


[11/15/2022 19:47] vdecentralised
that's correct when either `createStakehouse` or `joinStakehouse` is called


[11/15/2022 19:49] lukejohn_
thanks for the confirmation.


[11/15/2022 23:39] perseverancesuccess2021
Hello @vdecentralised   I have a question related to "## Recommended Mitigation Steps"  . It is in the template for the bug. Sometimes it is difficult to think about and take time. Is it needed to fill this information? Is it required or have some bonus for doing so? I ask because it takes time sometimes and also not sure if my recommendation of mitigation is really good.


[11/16/2022 00:07] liveactionllamac4
Hi! I would recommend reading through our docs, especially here: https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-policy

Then if you have further questions, please ask in #❓questions or #🐺wardens, as this is more of a general topic about submissions, not something specifically related to this contest. Thanks! 🙂


[11/16/2022 00:17] perseverancesuccess2021
Ok. thank you very much. By the way, I asked the question and read the docs but not so clear. I will tag you with my question in the question channel.

[11/18/2022 15:13] 0xpathfindr
Since this takes uint256, is the commission calculated as a percentage ? e.g if I place 10 as the optional commission it would be 10/100 ? i.e 10%???

@🧦 sockdrawer | C4 @CloudEllie - away The contest should be re-judged by a different judge. These are invalid findings (there might be more):

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse-findings/issues/366
bringUnusedETHBackIntoGiantPool simply calls burnLPTokensForETH on addresses provided by user. It doesn't transfer funds to the addresses or anything like that.  "the attacker can transfer LPTokens that belongs to GiantMevAndFeesPool to any addresses it controls." – this is not true!

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse-findings/issues/328
Reentrancies are very hard to exploit, even if code allows them. The finding doesn't absolutely explain how they can be exploited "to steal founds or take advantage of other users/protocol". The finding looks more like a QA, even though there's no justification for nonReentrant.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse-findings/issues/260
withdrawETH withdraws idle ETH, which doesn't receive rewards. There's no need to distribute rewards to depositors of idle ETH since the funds haven't been used in staking yet.

@Jeiwan This isn’t how C4 works. Judges make the final call based on review and input and we move forward and focus on improving process and consistency for the future. There is a discussion about adding an appeal process and I’d suggest you focus on adding your thoughts to that and other conversations rather than relitigating an audit that is already wrapped. https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues/73

Sad to hear that you're aware of the situation and your decision is just to move on. Bad judging significantly harms C4 on many levels.


[12/23/2022 03:29] sockdrawermoney
I’m not aware of a “situation” as much as “because humans” but the finality of judging is a very long-settled matter https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810936719003090974/908760695712149515

Have rewards already been shipped or only announced?

There are at least 2 High Solo findings that should've been invalid (240,226) even after post judging QA. (for backstage: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-stakehouse-findings/discussions/451)

This is bad for everyone involved:
- Wardens: unfair results and payout
- Judges: will lose respect and credibility from wardens
- Sponsors: receive invalid findings
- C4: loss of credibility for quality reports


[12/23/2022 04:16] soosh4618
(I didn't participate in the contest so I have no personal incentives. I just noticed a lot of inconsistencies for the judging for this contest as brought up by other wardens and think we can come up with a better resolution.)


[12/23/2022 04:23] jeiwan
I believe I won't be wrong if I say that no one in this community has doubts in Alex's conscientiousness. But I cannot say that about the judge of this contest. And seeing that clearly invalid findings were approved as high ones and how post-judging QA issues were ignored, I cannot say I have any trust for the judge as a security researcher or someone who's eligible for judging security audit contests. It's hard to believe that an experienced security researcher could make such mistakes.


[12/23/2022 05:03] sockdrawermoney
As I mentioned in our DM conversation, there is nothing C4 staff can or will do to change or overrule a judge’s decision. It is outside the scope of our responsibility and propriety of the integrity of the process. 

I highly encourage people to redirect energy toward suggesting process-focused solutions to the concerns you have, as there is not a mechanism for me or Ellie or anyone else to overrule a judge. 

While we are on the topic of conscientiousness, I will also direct people to refamiliarize yourselves with the community values we have outlined here:
